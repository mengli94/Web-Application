1 why my app generates POST requests?

The GET method requests transfer of a current selected representation for the target resource. The POST method requests that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request according to the resource’s own specific semantics.Because our server-side web application must be stateless, the webpage just need submit some data. So，POST requests are more suitable. 

2 The basic function && test data                                                               
24+19x20-10 = 850
68-97=-29 15/13 = 1
5/0 = ZeroError
input = “abc” ValueError                                         
*** After the equal sign, it can compute based on the previous value ***
20+4=24-7=17*2=34   
*** Support negative input and calculation ***                          
-3+-6=-9 -3*-2=6 -7/2= -4 
-3+7-1=3+7=10-8=2                                                               
*** Re-start the calculator ***                          
When the first number is positive： just input number;                                
When the first number is negative： press button ’0’(return to zero) then input number;          
-3+-6=-9 0 -7+2=-5
