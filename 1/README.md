Hello~

Thank you to check my homework.

I first designed the wireframe for my webpages in Part One. But when I started the Part Two, I found that many functions I was unable to implement and something I need add, such as navigation bar. So, There are some differences in my wireframe and webpages. Hope you can understand。

After pushing my homework, I found some mistakes in my file. Especially, in my login-revised pages, I forgot to change the local address of the “Sign In”button. But it is beyond the deadline, so I could not modify it.
